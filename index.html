				<h2>BANKRUPTCY</h2>
				<h3>Chapter 7, 11, and 13</h3>
				
				<p>If you are having financial difficulty, let one of our experienced attorneys discuss 
				the many options that are available to you. We offer Chapter 7 bankruptcy services for 
				those that qualify and Chapter 13/Wage Earner payment plans. We STOP foreclosures, 
				repossessions, garnishments, evictions, and collection calls! We can also help get your 
				driver&#39;s license back for court fines or unpaid child support. Keep your utilities on or 
				get new utilities even if you have a high balance. Take back control of your money today!</p>
				
				<p>The decision to file bankruptcy is stressful. Harassing phone calls, collection letters, 
				threats of garnishment, foreclosure, or eviction can affect your daily life and your ability 
				to pay your monthly expenses. Don&#39;t let creditors tell you what to do with your finances, 
				take back control today!</p>
				
				<h2>CHILD SUPPORT</h2>
				<h3>Child Support Establishment, Modification (Increase or Decrease), Contempt, 
				Termination Establishment/Disestablishment of Paternity</h3>
				
				<p>Often times non-custodial parents make a huge mistake when they choose to represent 
				themselves in child support hearings and they are unaware of the laws and how the lack of 
				evidence and lack of preparation can negatively affect the outcome of their child support case.</p>
				
				<p>Tennessee adopted the income shares model and child support is based upon the income of 
				both parents with many other factors being considered such as childcare, health insurance, 
				reoccurring medical costs and extraordinary expenses. Our firm is experienced in all areas of 
				child support from the magistrate level to the appellate courts.</p>
				
				<h2>PERSONAL INJURY &amp; AUTO ACCIDENTS</h2>
				<h3>Let us help you get the settlement you deserve</h3>
				
				<p>We all know someone who has been seriously injured in a car wreck. When you have been seriously 
				injured in an auto accident, you deserve to be compensated for your claim. Most people cannot 
				immediately go back to work and are have trouble paying their current bills. Don't let medical bills 
				pile up without getting an experienced lawyer to fight for your rights against the insurance company. 
				Our attorneys will make sure you are fairly compensated for your injuries. We offer FREE consultations 
				and are available at any of our locations to serve you better.</p>
				
				<h2>DIVORCE</h2>
				<h3>Contested or Uncontested</h3>
				
				<p>A substantial number of marriages do not work out, but for many different reasons. We often find that 
				the everyday working person just cannot afford the legal fees that most attorneys charge and that most 
				people need an affordable option when they decide to file a divorce.</p>
				
				<p>We are skilled divorce trial attorneys having a reputation of being great advocates and receiving winning 
				results. We are affordable! Our uncontested divorce retainers start as low as $400 (with no chidren) & $500 
				(with children) and our contested divorce retainers start at $750. Some services may be paid in installments 
				and payment plans are also available.</p>
